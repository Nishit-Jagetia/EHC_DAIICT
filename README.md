This is where you will find people soldering circuits, wiring motors and working on projects like communicating with a motor through the serial port of a computer, or making a new multimedia keyboard or just creating disco lights for the next dance night, this is where it all happens.  Electronics Hobby Club is an integral part of DA-IICT ,which aims to inculcate and educate people in electronics and its various applications. EHC members conduct regular sessions on upcoming electronic technologies like Arduino, compatible sensors, RaspberryPi.  We encourage people to come forth and be a part of projects that would work in real-life scenarios. With projects we are not limited to expanding only in the electronic aspects but also going where the needs take us whether it is software development part of the project, developing projects or using AI to instruct the micro-controllers.
